##Matrix Problem - matrix_problem.py
* Description: 
Random generate a NxN matrix with only four types of element: 1,2,3,4. 
However, no column or row can have same type of element appears 3 times or above continuously (three same type of elements are connected)

ex: 

valid, below: 
>> 1 2 1 1

>> 3 1 4 2 

>> 1 2 4 2 

>> 3 1 2 3 

invalid, below: 
>> 1 2 1 3 

>> 1 3 4 2 

>> 1 2 4 4 

>> 2 3 2 2

because the first column has element 1 appears three times and all 1s are connected to each other.
